evelop a C++ project that computes a patient’s bill for a hospital stay. The project should include a
PatientAccountclass, a Surgeryclass, and a Pharmacyclass.
· The PatientAccountclass should keep track of the total number of days the patient has spent in the
hospital, and computes the total charge for the entire stay (given that the hospital’s daily room rate
is £200). This class will also add any additional charges to the patient’s bill if fees have been incurred
for any surgery or medication.
· The Surgeryclass contains a record of charges for different types of surgeries, as shown below. The
class should also print a user menu to allow the user to query a particular charge.
Cataract surgery £1500
Debridement £180
Low back pain surgery £900
Tonsillectomy £2100
· The Pharmacyclass contains a record of prices for different types of medication, as shown below.
It also prints a user menu to allow the user to query prices.
Antibiotic £20
Anti-inflammatory £17
Anti-nausea £38
Inhalant £66
Pain Relief £35
The program should prompt the user to input the number of days that a patient has stayed in the hospital, the
type of surgery that has been carried out (if any), the medication (if any), and print out the total bill for that
patient.
